# Dunhuang-unicode

This repository contains a Unicode version of the current state of the Tibetan [manuscript of Dunhuang](http://idp.bl.uk/). It comes from two main sources: 

- [Old Tibetan Documents Online](http://otdo.aa-ken.jp/)
- work by Brandon Dotson for his book [Old Tibetan Annals](http://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/The-Old-Tibetan-Annals)

The tags in the text have been removed and the safest option have been taken, but it still contains mistakes and unknown blocks.

The aim is to be able to treat Dunhuang texts as a digital corpus that can be analyzed.
